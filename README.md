As near as I can tell the main thing here is to 
1) create a Git repositiory using the template from https://github.com/prunderground-dev/wordpress-frontend-interview-starter 
2) Use composer to set up a new WordPress install locally http://127.0.0.1/ernie-assessment/public/wp/
3) Add a wp-config to the new WordPress install 
4) Create a plugin signing up a user and adding them to the database. This involves adding dtabase table on activation 
5) add form that inserts data to new database
6) Form appears on scroll
7) disapears on submit ( I did not finish this it still shows on scroll after submission)
